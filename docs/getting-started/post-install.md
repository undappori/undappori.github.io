## If you're new to NeoVim/Vim

We strongly encourage you to learn how to use NeoVim/Vim, as it's more than a normal text editor.

:::tip
These are highly recommend and a **must do for any new Vimmer**

- Vim tutor
  ```
  :Tutor
  ```
- In-built help docs
  ```
  :h <cmd>
  :h autocommand
  :h nvim.api
  :h insert
  ```
- [Google your issue](https://google.com)
  - Example format query, `neovim how to delete 10 lines`
    :::
- [NeoVim quick reference](https://neovim.io/doc/user/quickref.html)
- Vim movement games
  - [Vim Adventures](https://vim-adventures.com/)
  - [Vim Genius](http://www.vimgenius.com/)

After the initial installation, we recommend setting up a few things based on your needs.

## Setup your custom config

In order to set any custom options, you must use the `lua/custom/` directory. This is to protect your own customisations when updating NvChad.

- `custom/init.lua` gets run during NeoVim setup, it's a way to run general purpose code & run extensive NvChad modifications
- `custom/chadrc.lua` is used to override `core/default_config.lua`, you only need to include values that you wish to change from the default file

---

NvChad provides `example_init.lua` & `example_chadrc.lua` inside of the `custom` folder.

To start setting up NvChad to your needs, copy these template files:

```
cp example_init.lua init.lua
cp example_chadrc.lua chadrc.lua
```

## Install Treesitter Parser(s)

The goal of `nvim-treesitter` is to provide basic functionality such as syntax-highlighting for various languages. For more info check out their repository at [nvim-treesitter](https://github.com/nvim-treesitter/nvim-treesitter).

For example, to install the treesitter parser for `css`:

```shell
:TSInstall css
```

For a list of supported languages, please checkout the [docs](https://github.com/nvim-treesitter/nvim-treesitter#supported-languages).

## Theming

NvChad ships with many themes. The default theme is `onedark`.

You may switch themes with this mapping: `<leader> + th`.

This will open a telescope fuzzy finder, with which you can preview and select a new default theme.
